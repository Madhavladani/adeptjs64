page.tsx devmode

I've made several improvements to handle the "email rate limit exceeded" error:
Added specific error handling for rate limit errors in the signup API with a more user-friendly message.
Created a development mode toggle (enabled in your .env file) that:
Bypasses email verification entirely
Uses the admin API to create pre-confirmed user accounts
Shows a visual indicator on both signup and login pages
Updated the UI to show clearer messages when rate limits are hit.
Fixed the Next.js config warning by removing the deprecated optimizeFonts option.
The dev mode is especially useful for local development as it lets you:
Create users without triggering emails
Avoid hitting rate limits
Test the full authentication flow without waiting for confirmation emails
In production, you would set NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=false or remove it completely to ensure real email verification takes place.
Try the signup process again - with dev mode enabled, you should be able to create accounts without hitting the email rate limit.
